# Digit-Recognition-using-CNN

- Dataset used : MNIST
(MNIST database is a large collection of handwritten digits. It has a training set of 60,000 examples, and a test set of 10,000 examples.)

The handwritten digit recognition project leverages a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to accurately classify images of digits (0-9) from the MNIST dataset. The model is built with a series of convolutional and pooling layers to automatically extract features from 28x28 grayscale images, followed by fully connected dense layers for classification. Trained on thousands of labeled digit images, the model achieves high accuracy, with the ability to generalize well to unseen data. Early stopping is implemented to prevent overfitting, ensuring optimal performance on the validation set. The project demonstrates the effectiveness of deep learning in image classification tasks, particularly in recognizing handwritten digits with near-human accuracy.
